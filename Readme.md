This is a tool for master analysts to drive their organizations' IT Security efforts. The data from this report is the SANS Institute (https://www.sans.org/critical-security-controls). This Rmd project generates automated linguistic analysis report of the International IT Security Critical Security Controls published by SANS, ver. 2016. 

The original Csc document is largely confusing and hard to read, but surprisingly clear when the extra words are removed and the data is visualized in a new way. I created this program to automatically generate the intelligence report on the Critical Security Controls meant for high level management to drive the Security effort of the organization. 

Go ahead and download the intelligence report to audit your security level of your organizations' IT infrastructure. 

If you are an IT manager or involved with IT security in any way, the pdf files are a good download to supplement the Csc document from SANS. 

IT managers or analysts should download all the pdf files and combine them into a single file. As of writing this I don't have Acrobat X and cannot combine Pdf files and maintain the indexing which is a nice feature, so I leave the files uncombined. 

If you are interested in how the files are generated or wish to customize the report, then you will need the Rmd files. The R code files contain the Data and Functions to generate wordclouds from the original Csc document which is wordy and hard to read. 

Another application for this tool would be for legal professionals that need to scan and condense large bodies of legal texts or court documents into a scannable intelligence report. 

License for this software is the same as the license for the CSC from SANS Institute (MIT license). See pdf for license information. Thanks and comments welcome.
