#Tool for analysts to audit IT Security efforts. 

This report is the SANS Institute (https://www.sans.org/critical-security-controls) Critical Security Controls (CSC published by SANS, ver. 2016. 

The original Csc document is largely confusing and hard to read, but surprisingly clear when the extra words are removed and the data is visualized in a new way. I created this program to automatically generate the intelligence report on the Critical Security Controls meant for high level management to drive the Security effort of the organization. 

License for this software is the same as the license for the CSC from SANS Institute (MIT license). See pdf for license information. Thanks and comments welcome.
