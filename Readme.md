This is a tool for master analysts to drive their organizations' IT Security efforts. Ths project is to generate an automated report of the International IT Security Critical Security Controls, ver. 2016. 

The original Csc document is largely confusing and hard to read, so I created this program to automatically generate an intelligence report on the Critical Security Controls. 

Go ahead and download the files and start to secure your organizations' IT infrastructure today. 

If you are an IT manager or involved with IT security in any way, the pdf files are a good download to supplement the Csc Congress document. 

All Pdf files should just be combined into one large report, but as of reading this I don't have Acrobat X and cannot combine Pdf files and maintain the indexing which is a nice feature, so I leave the files uncombined. 

IT managers or analysts should download all the pdf files and combine them into a single file. 

If you are interested in how the files are generated or wish to customize the report, then you will need the Rmd files. 

The R code files contain the Data and Functions to generate wordclouds from the original Csc document which is wordy and hard to read.
